# IBM-DataAnalysis-Capstone
IBM Data Analysis Professional Certificate Capstone Project

In this project, I will act as a newly hired Data Analyst for a global IT and business consulting services firm.
My organization regularly analyzes data to help identify future skill requirements, in order to keep pace with changing technologies and remain competitive. 

To assist in this initiative, as a Data Analyst I'll collect data from various sources, APIs and Web Scraping, to identifying trends for this year's report on emerging skills.
